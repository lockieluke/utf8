# UTF8 - Simple Library for Internationalization # {#mainpage}

This is a library designed to simplify the usage of UTF-8 strings under Win32 using the strategy advocated by [UTF-8 Everywhere Manifesto](http://utf8everywhere.org/).

While most of the (computing) world has standardized on using UTF-8 encoding,
Win32 has remained stuck with wide character strings (also called UTF-16 encoding).

## Content
The main function groups are:
- \ref basecvt "Narrowing/widening functions"
- \ref charclass "Character classification functions"
- \ref folding  "Case folding and case-insensitive comparison" 
- \ref inifile "INI file replacement API"
- \ref reg "Registry functions"

There are also functions for:
- character counting - \ref utf8::length() "length"
- string traversal - \ref utf8::next() "next" and \ref utf8::prev() "prev"
- validity checking - \ref utf8::valid_str() "valid_str"

In addition to those, there are wrappings for commonly used C and C++ functions:
- file access operations: \ref utf8::fopen() "fopen", \ref utf8::access() "access", 
\ref utf8::remove() "remove", \ref utf8::chmod() "chmod", \ref utf8::rename() "rename"
- directory operations: \ref utf8::mkdir() "mkdir", \ref utf8::rmdir() "rmdir", 
\ref utf8::chdir() "chdir", \ref utf8::getcwd() "getcwd"
- symbolic link creation: \ref utf8::symlink() "symlink"
- path management: \ref utf8::splitpath() "splitpath", \ref utf8::makepath() "makepath"
- environment functions: \ref utf8::getenv() "getenv", \ref utf8::putenv() "putenv"
- conversion of command-line arguments: \ref utf8::get_argv() "getargv" and \ref utf8::free_argv() "freeargv"
- program execution: \ref utf8::system() "system"
- C++ I/O streams: \ref utf8::ifstream "ifstream", \ref utf8::ofstream "ofstream", \ref utf8::fstream "fstream"
- File enumerating functions: \ref utf8::find_first() "find_first", \ref utf8::find_next() "find_next"
- A \ref utf8::file_enumerator "file enumerator" object wrapping find_first/find_next functions.
- A simple \ref utf8::buffer "buffer class" for handling Windows API parameters. 
- \ref utf8::IniFile "IniFile" - a class for handling Windows "profile files" API.
- Some frequently used Windows functions like \ref utf8::MessageBox() "MessageBox", 
\ref utf8::LoadString() "LoadString", \ref utf8::ShellExecute "ShellExecute", 
\ref utf8::GetTempPath "GetTempPath", \ref utf8::GetTempFileName "GetTempFileName", 
\ref utf8::GetFullPathName "GetFullPathName", \ref utf8::CopyFile "CopyFile",
\ref utf8::GetModuleFileName "GetModuleFileName"

## Usage
### General
Before using this library you might want to review the guidelines from the
[UTF-8 Everywhere Manifesto](http://utf8everywhere.org/). In particular:
- define UNICODE or _UNICODE in your program
- for Visual Studio users, make sure "Use Unicode Character Set" option is defined
  under "General" > "Project Defaults" tab.
- for Visual Studio users, add [`/utf-8`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/utf-8-set-source-and-executable-character-sets-to-utf-8) option under "C/C++" > "All Options" >
  "Additional Options".
- use only `std::string` and `char*` variables. Assume they all contain UTF-8
  encoded strings.
- use UTF-16 strings only in arguments to Windows API calls.

All functions and classes in this library are included in the *utf8* namespace.
It is a good idea __not__ to have a using directive for this namespace. That makes it
more evident in the code where UTF8-aware functions are used.

This is an example of a function call:
```cpp
  std::string dirname = "ελληνικό";
  utf8::mkdir (dirname);   //create a directory with a UTF8-encoded name
```
Most functions mimic the behavior of standard C functions. A notable exception is
the access() function. The utf8::access() function returns a bool value while the
standard library function returns 0 if the file can be accessed.
 
### I/O Streams
Wrappers for C++ I/O streams can be used for file streams with UTF-8 encoded filenames.
This is an example of a C++ stream with a weird name and content:
```cpp
  std::string filename = "ελληνικό";
  std::string filetext{ "😃😎😛" };

  utf8::ofstream u8strm(filename);

  u8strm << filetext << endl;
  u8strm.close ();
```
Translation from UTF-16 to UTF-8 applies only to file names. C++ streams are agnostic
about their content.

Calling Windows API functions can be handled using the generic widening and
narrowing functions like this example:
```cpp
  std::string filename = "ελληνικό";
  HANDLE f = CreateFile (utf8::widen (filename).c_str (), GENERIC_READ, 0,
    NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
```

### INI File Handling
INI files, also called "profile files" in Microsoft parlance are still widely used for storing application settings used either for compatibility reasons or because they are simple to work with.

The problem is that the basic Windows API calls for reading and writing INI files, `GetPrivateProfileString` and `PutPrivateProfileString`, combine both the file name and the information to be read or written in one API call. As an example, here is the signature of the `GetPrivateProfileStringW` function:
```cpp
DWORD GetPrivateProfileStringW(
  LPCWSTR lpAppName,
  LPCWSTR lpKeyName,
  LPCWSTR lpDefault,
  LPWSTR  lpReturnedString,
  DWORD   nSize,
  LPCWSTR lpFileName
);
```
Using the `utf8::widen` function to convert all UTF-8 strings would produce an INI file that contains UTF-16 characters.

The solution is to completely forget about the Windows API functions and roll a new implementation for accessing INI files. This is by far not the only implementation of INI files that you can find out there. For a list of implementations you can check the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file). This implementation struggles to be as compatible as possible with the original Windows API.

The only changes compared to the Windows API are:
 - line length defaults to 1024 (the INI_BUFFER_SIZE value) while Windows limits it to 256 characters
 - files without a path are in current directory while Windows places them in Windows folder

### Case Conversion
Case conversion in Unicode is a more complicated issue than ASCII case conversion.
This library uses standard tables published by Unicode Consortium to perform conversions between upper-case
and lower-case. There is also a function `utf8::icompare()` that performs string
comparison ignoring the case.

### Error Handling
Invalid characters or sequences can be handled in two different ways:
- the invalid character/sequence is replaced by a `utf8::REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER` (0xFFFD)
- the functions throw an exception `utf8::exception`. The member `utf8::exception::code` indicates what has triggered the exception.

The function `utf8::error_mode()` selects the error handling strategy. The error handling strategy is thread-safe: each thread has its own strategy.

## Building
The UTF8 library doesn't have any dependencies. The test program however uses the [UTTP library](https://github.com/neacsum/utpp).

The preferred method is to use the [CPM - C/C++ Package Manager](https://github.com/neacsum/cpm) to fetch all dependent packages and build them. Download the [CPM program](https://github.com/neacsum/cpm/releases/latest/download/cpm.exe) and, from the root of the development tree, issue the `cpm` command:
```
  cpm -u https://github.com/neacsum/utf8.git utf8
```

The Visual C++ projects are set to compile under C++14 rules and they also compiles fine under C++17 rules. If you are using C++20 rules, you have to add the [`Zc:char8_t-`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/zc-char8-t?view=msvc-170) option.

You can build the library using CMake. From the utf8 directory:
```
  cmake -S . -B build
  cmake --build build
```

Alternatively, `BUILD.bat` script will build the libraries and test programs.
